Problem: Two Strings

Given two strings, determine if they share at least one common substring.
A substring may be as small as one character.

Input

Two strings s1 and s2.

Each string consists of lowercase English letters (aâ€“z).

Output

Print "YES" if they share at least one common substring.

Print "NO" if they do not.

Example 1

Input:

s1 = "hello"
s2 = "world"


Output:

YES


Explanation:
Both strings share the character 'o'.

Example 2

Input:

s1 = "hi"
s2 = "world"


Output:

NO


Explanation:
There are no common characters between "hi" and "world".

Constraints

1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 10^5

Strings consist of only lowercase English letters.
